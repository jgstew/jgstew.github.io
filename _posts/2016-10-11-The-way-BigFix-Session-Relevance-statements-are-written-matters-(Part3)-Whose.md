The order of operations within a complex `WHOSE` clause matters in BigFix Relevance but especially in Session Relevance.

A `WHOSE` clause takes plural results (similar to arrays) and filters out the unwanted items.

Here are 2 examples:

    Q: number of it whose(it contains "b") of ("b";"abc";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac")
    A: 3
    T: 0.054 ms
    I: singular integer

    Q: number of it whose(it starts with "a") of ("b";"abc";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac")
    A: 3
    T: 0.043 ms
    I: singular integer

Generally, `starts with` will be faster than `contains` because `contains` is more dependent upon the length of the string being examined than `starts with` is.

This means that if you want to know which strings start with `a` and contain `b`, you should first filter by `starts with` before using `contains`. Both of the following examples are equivalent, but the first is faster:

    Q: number of it whose(it starts with "a" AND it contains "b") of ("b";"abc";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac")
    A: 2
    T: 0.037 ms
    I: singular integer

    Q: number of it whose(it contains "b" AND it starts with "a") of ("b";"abc";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab";"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac")
    A: 2
    T: 0.049 ms
    I: singular integer

The reason that this works is because when statements are combined with `AND` inside of a `WHOSE` clause, the first statement to be false stops the evaluation and eliminates the result immediately.

This means you generally want the fastest to evaluate items first in the `WHOSE` clause, except in rare cases in which you also have to care about how many of the results the statement eliminates. If a statement is very fast, but only eliminates a small percentage of the results, then it may be better to use a statement that is a tad slower but eliminates a larger set of the results so that the subsequent clauses have less items to evaluate.

----------

Now lets take a real world example using Session Relevance and try to optimize it.

The use case is to dynamically query for a running Firefox patch baseline. All of the following statements should return the 1 and only open action that meets all of the criteria.

This version takes ~40ms:

    number of bes actions whose(name of it as lowercase contains "Firefox" as lowercase AND source of source fixlet of it contains "RESTAPI: Generate " AND baseline flag of source fixlet of it AND "jgstew" = name of issuer of it AND name of it as lowercase contains "Windows" as lowercase AND "Open" = state of it)

Lets see if moving the check for state to the front is faster: (~20ms)

    number of bes actions whose("Open" = state of it AND name of it as lowercase contains "Firefox" as lowercase AND source of source fixlet of it contains "RESTAPI: Generate " AND baseline flag of source fixlet of it AND "jgstew" = name of issuer of it AND name of it as lowercase contains "Windows" as lowercase)

This turns out to be twice as fast! But why?

----------

Let's break it down individually and see.

- ~12ms: `number of bes actions whose("Open"= state of it)`
- ~36ms: `number of bes actions whose(name of it as lowercase contains "Firefox" as lowercase)`
- ~12ms: `number of bes actions whose(source of source fixlet of it contains "RESTAPI: Generate ")`
- ~14ms: `number of bes actions whose("jgstew" = name of issuer of it)`
-  ~8ms: `number of bes actions whose(baseline flag of source fixlet of it)`
- ~37ms: `number of bes actions whose(name of it as lowercase contains "Windows" as lowercase)`

----------

Now, let's reorder the `WHOSE` clause to go from fastest to slowest: (~10ms)

    number of bes actions whose(baseline flag of source fixlet of it AND "Open"= state of it AND source of source fixlet of it contains "RESTAPI: Generate " AND "jgstew" = name of issuer of it AND name of it as lowercase contains "Firefox" as lowercase AND name of it as lowercase contains "Windows" as lowercase )

That is almost twice as fast again!

----------

But can we do better?

- ~3ms: `number of bes actions whose(multiple flag of it)`

----------

Final result: (~4ms)

    number of bes actions whose(multiple flag of it AND baseline flag of source fixlet of it AND "Open"= state of it AND source of source fixlet of it contains "RESTAPI: Generate " AND "jgstew" = name of issuer of it AND name of it as lowercase contains "Firefox" as lowercase AND name of it as lowercase contains "Windows" as lowercase )

So what? 4ms is 10 times faster than 40ms, but 40ms is still pleanty fast. Why bother with all of this optimization in this case? It is a valid point that for this particular usecase in my particular environment, this optimization will make very little difference overall, BUT it is important to understand that this optimization could have a much greater impact in a different environment with many more items to filter or more criteria to filter on.

#### The bigger the difference between the fastest query and the slowest query, the more optimization like this will make a difference.
