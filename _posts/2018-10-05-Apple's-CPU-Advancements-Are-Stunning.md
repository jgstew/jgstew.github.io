Apple has been doing some of the most interesting work on CPUs in recent history, making significant leaps year over year. I really think that if Apple can keep up this pace, then it makes an Apple ARM CPU based "laptop" inevitable. I think it is unlikely that Apple would switch away from Intel entirely for quite some time, but I would not be surprised to see at least one "laptop" like device that is ARM only as early as next year. The thing that I'm most unsure of is will it run iOS or MacOS, especially considering MacOS can [run "iOS" apps](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1047465790784585728) already, and I only expect that to [get better over time](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1044577455938437120).

I also think we might see a more traditional MacOS laptop that runs both an ARM CPU and an Intel CPU as early as next year. This is in some ways just taking what Apple is already doing with the T2 further. In a similar hybrid CPU twist, the new iPhones actually contain an x86 CPU: https://twitter.com/cynicalsecurity/status/1040611124784312321

I really love anandtech's analysis of the new Apple CPUs:

"Apple claims the new CPUs perform around 15% better than last year’s A11 Monsoon cores – here it seems the company’s marketing was a tad conservative as the real performance figures of the new CPU are significantly higher." [seems like Apple is quoting the minimum performance improvement]

"The take-away here is that Apple’s caches are just immense, and the A12 further expands in that regard by doubling the system cache size. In practice, we have around 16MB of useable cache hierarchy on the part of the big CPU cores – a massive amount that just puts the memory and cache subsystems of competing SoCs to shame." [only some of the Intel i9 CPUs have a greater L3 Cache]

"Apple’s microarchitecture seems to far surpass anything else in terms of width, including desktop CPUs."

"Apple’s SoCs have better energy efficiency than all recent Android SoCs while having a nearly 2x performance advantage. I wouldn’t be surprised that if we were to normalize for energy used, Apple would have a 3x performance efficiency lead."

It really seems like Apple has the best CPU in terms of performance efficiency (performance per watt) of any CPU (not limited to mobile). This means Apple could definitely get even better single threaded performance with less thermal and power constraints, and could get better multi-core performance just by adding more cores. If iPad Pros come with a higher core count A12X CPU, then they could be monsters, and I think Apple selling an Apple ARM CPU based "laptop" as soon as next year is very likely, (though I don't expect them to convert the whole line away from Intel for a while) which is not good for Intel's future.
