I have the Windows [Fixlet Debugger](http://software.bigfix.com/download/bes/92/util/QNA9.2.0.363.zip) working on OS X bundled into a .app using [WineBottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/).

**Download here:** [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/640753/FixletDebugger_9.2.9.36_OSX_WINE_SIGNED.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/640753/FixletDebugger_9.2.9.36_OSX_WINE_SIGNED.zip)

**Note:** This will be running under the WINE context, which thinks it is Windows XP. This will not work with OS X only relevance, and it may not work with all Windows based relevance either. I have not tested this enough to know what works and what doesn't, but I still think this could be useful.

You can recreate what I did by downloading [WineBottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/combo/builds/WineBottlerCombo_1.6.1.dmg) and use the following settings:

![All files in folder, Set DirectDraw to GDI](https://jgstew.github.io/images/Winebottler_FixletDebugger_9.2.png "Screenshot of Winebottler")

This may be an option for many Windows Only utilities on OS X. The Session Relevance Tester comes to mind.
