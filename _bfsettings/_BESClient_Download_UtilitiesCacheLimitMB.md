### Default: 10MB (10)

### Recommendation: 200MB (200) or more

- This setting controls the maximum size of the pool of storage to hold utilities in a separate cache that does not get cleared out in the same way as the Client's Download Cache.
- In order for things to be stored in the client utility cache, they have to be explicitly added through actionscript command.
- This cache is designed for small files that are used across many different actions where you would not want them to have to be redownloaded everytime.
